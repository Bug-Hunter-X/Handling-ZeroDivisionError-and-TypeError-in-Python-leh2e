This repository demonstrates an uncommon error handling scenario in Python.  The `bug.py` file contains a function that attempts division, which can throw both ZeroDivisionError (division by zero) and TypeError exceptions (if operands are of incompatible types). The `bugSolution.py` file effectively handles both cases to prevent program crashes and provides more informative error messages.  This scenario highlights the need for robust error handling in Python programs to ensure stability and user-friendliness.
